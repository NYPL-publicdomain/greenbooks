THE WILLIAM H. GREEN :3;
EDITOR ,
NEGRO MOTORIST JOHN C. DILLARD "

GREEN BOOK CIRCULATION MGR. :

INTRODUCTION 3.

The idea of “The Green Book” is to give the Motorist and Tour-
ist a Guide not only of the Hotels and Tourist Homes in all of the
large cities, but other classiﬁcations that will be found useful wherever
he may be. Also facts and information that the Negro Motorist can
use and depend upon. ‘

There are thousands of places that the public doesn’t know about «3
and aren’t listed. Perhaps you might know of some? If so send in their '
names and addresses and the kind of business, so that we might pass it
along to the rest of your fellow Motorists.

You will ﬁnd it handy on your travels and up to date. Each
year we are compiling n..vv lists; as some of these places move, or go
out of‘ business and new business is started.

All of our Advertisers have been selected with care and are ‘S
the best represenative and responsible in their ﬁeld. One will always
ﬁnd them willing and rear‘y to serve the best that there is.

When you are .veling m ntion “The Green Book” so as to ’
let these people know jist how yr u found out about their place of
business. If they haVeen’t heard about This Guide, tell them to get in
touch with us

If this Cuide is useful, let us know, if not tell us also, as we
appreciate your or iticisziis.

If any eriiors .‘re form}, kindly notify he publishers so that
they can be corrected in the nest issue.
