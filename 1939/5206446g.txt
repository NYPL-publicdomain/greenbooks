SUMMER RESORTS

Have you made plans for your vacation?

   

“The Green Book” is

Willing to help you. Vacations depend upon what you want to do and
how much time and money you have to spend while doing it. Many a

vacation has been spoiled because there was no system of approach to ,

it. Most people want rest, others want to travel in their home country.
So plan your vacation ahead of time. No matter what you want to do
during your vacation make a good job of it. If you are going to travel,
whether in ﬁrst class style or by the cheapest method just be sure to
go to the place that is most interesting and come back to your home or

job feeling ﬁt.
