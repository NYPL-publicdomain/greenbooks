printing, and the manufacture of farm
implements and machinery, leather
goods, plumbers’ supplies, sanitary
equipment, reed organs, baseball bats,
boxes, nicotine products, textiles,
paints, varnishes and automobile are
all part of Louisville’s contribution
to modern living. Additional assets to
the city’s economy are the various
military establishments in and around
Louisville, such as Fort Knox where
the United States gold reserve is
stored; the U. S. Quartermaster de-
pot at Jeffersonville, Indiana and the
municipal and military airﬁeld at Bow-
man Field.

Churches

There are some 200 churches, rep-
resenting nearly all creeds in Louis-
ville. The principal denominations are
the Baptists, the Methodists, the Pres-
byterians, the Christians, the Episco-
palians, the Catholics and the Luther—
ans but there are also Unitarians,
Evangelists, Jews and those who call
themselves, Non-sectarians, Scientists,
Seventh-Day Adventists, Social Set—
tlement, Spiritualism, Swedenborgians,
United Brethren and Theosophists.
Some of the Houses of worship, like
the Cathedral of the Assumption, the
Warren Memorial, the Third Avenue
Baptist Church and Fourth Street
Christian are ﬁne specimens of eccle-
siastical architecture and capable of
seating large congregations.

Social Advancement

Many early planters who later be-
came associated with the life of the
city were large slave owners and the
residents of Louisville kept house
servants who, after the manner of the
time, assumed the family name. This
transplanted Negro stock is the foun-
dation of the city’s present Negro life
and culture. Despite his background
of decades of slavery the Negro in
Louisville, has adapted himself re—

markably well to the environment of
freedom. Illiteracy has dropped from
about 96% in 1865 to a percentage

well only slightly above the whites.»
Illiterates, white and Negro, reported.

by the United States census reached
a low 2.2. The ﬁrst free public li-
brary for Negroes, with Negro at-

tendants, was opened in 1905 as a '

branch of the city public library.
Louisville is the only city in the State

that has two Carnegie branch build- .

ings for Negro readers. Local Ne-
groes have a complete system of pri-
mary and secondary schools in addition
to the Louisville Municipal College—

part of the University of Louisville.

The U. S. census recorded that 45.6%

of all Negro families, are home own- ‘

ers in Louisville. Negro neighbor-
hoods have their own stores, hotels, res-
taurants, newspaper publishing houses,
and theaters. The voting power of the
City’s 47,354 Negro population is a
huge factor in the progress of the
race in Louisville.

Education

The University of Louisville is an
accredited, co-educational institution.
It is located on ﬁve separate campuses
in Louisville and is under public con-
trol. The University is the oldest mu-
nicipal school in America. Although
it was chartered as the Louisville Col-
legiate Institute by an act of the city
council in 1798, for a medical school,
instruction did not begin until 1837.
The University of Louisville, char-
tered in 1847, absorbed the college’s
academic department. Today some
scholarship help is available but more
than half of the students earn part of
their expenses. Residential facilities
are extremely limited however and
though there are fraternities and so-
rorities on the campus, they do not
provide living quarters for out-of—
town students, who are dependent
mainly on accommodations outside the
college.
