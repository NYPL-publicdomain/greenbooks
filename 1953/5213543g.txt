odds, while feminine chatter concerns
itself with arriving guests, food se-
lections for traditional Derby break-
fasts and of course, the eternal ques—
tion and selection of clothes for the

big day.

Highways entering the City from
all over the U. S. carry a steadily in—
creasing number of automobiles and
buses into the downtown area during
Derby week, and Louisville becomes
the most feverish city in the nation.
Hotels are “all out”. The streets teem
with thousands of hysterical towns-
people and visitors. A kind of crazi-
ness afﬂicts people so that even the
Kentucky absentee is likely to glue
his ear to the radio, ﬁrst having made
sure that there are plenty of refresh-
ments on hand.

Notable and nobodies mingle, touts
and tycoons, owners and swipers all
beat inwardly to an excitement that
no one can adequately describe. It is
a horse race, fashion show, spring
festival mob. 70,000 people pack the

stands, bleachers and inﬁeld at
Churchill Downs. The crowd is so
thick that many are prevented from
catching more than a glimpse of the
classic Run of the Roses. It is in-
teresting to note that despite this in-
convenience no one leaves his position
until the start and ﬁnish of the race,
which in slightly more than two min-
utes, is recorded. They then join the
thousands at Churchill Downs and
elsewhere in cheers of appreciation
for the winner and immediately com-
mence anticipation proceedings for
next year’s “Darby”.

Time has not dimmed the ardent
desire of the Kentucky Derby’s origi-
nator nor has it reduced the thrills,
the ﬁre, and the hospitality which it
creates, but rather has contributed to
the splendor and glory of one of
America’s great traditions . . . De—
mocracy! The Kentucky Derby is a

spectacle indeed; a human spectacle

it would be difﬁcult, if not impossible
to duplicate.
