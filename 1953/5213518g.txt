American Airlines

American Airlines’ performance in
covering 72 cities, making 300 ﬂights
a day and averaging well over
9,000,000 passenger-miles daily, more
than substantiates the claim describ-
ing it as, “America’s Leading Airline”.

Among the cities served from coast
to coast are Los Angeles, San Fran-
cisco, Dallas, Tulsa, Chicago, Boston,
New York and Washington. Inter-
nationally, they serve Toronto, Can-
ada, Mexico City, and Monterrey,
south of the border.

Their hourly ﬂights from New
York to Chicago and return, with the
same service from New York to Bos-
ton and New York to Washington, is
a special feature of interest to busy
people.

On their “name” ﬂights such as the
MERCURY, American Airlines fea-
ture huge leaps across the country
stopping only in Chicago, and cover-
ing the entire distance westbound in
only eight hours. The AZTEC which
ﬂies New York, Washington, Dallas
and Mexico City takes only ten hours

on the westbound tour.

The originator of the now famous
Family Fare Plan, through which a
husband may ﬂy his wife and chil-
dren at half fare, Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday each week, American
Airlines has attracted a whole new
market. Proverbial stay-at-homes are
now enjoying this new kind of in—
expensive travel as well as large num-
bers of servicemen and students.

In its ﬁrst published survey of
Airtourist travel, American Airlines
reported that 64 percent of Airtourist
passengers are vacationeers while 32
percent are on business trips and the '
rest travelling in answer to some
urgent personal business.

The only long—distance transporta-
tion outﬁt in the world which handles
more people than American Airlines
is the Pennsylvania Railroad.
