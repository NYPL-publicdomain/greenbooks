Trans World Airlines

In 1926 and 1927 three of TWA’s
parent companies—Western Air Ex-
press, Standard Airlines and Maddux
Air Lines—ﬂew small groups of pas-
sengers on short routes between west-
ern cities. Its more immediate prede-
cessor company, Trans—Continental
Air Transport, began the ﬁrst coast
to coast air passenger service in 1929.
Passengers ﬂew in Ford trimotors by
day and rode the railroad at night
arriving at their destination after 48

hours of travel.

The four companies became Trans-
continental and Western Air Inc.
(T'WA’s former Corporate name),
on October 1, 1930. Twenty-ﬁve days
later all—air service was introduced,
slashing transcontinental travel time

to 36 hours.

Today, TWA transports two mil-
lion passengers a year, 34,400,000 car-
go ton miles including mail ,coast to
coast. The average time reported for
each trip is ten hours.

After extensive surveys of traﬁic

potentialities and needs, TWA pre-

sented its plans for international serv-

ice. The Civil Aeronautics Board, on

July 5, 1945, in a decision signed by
President Truman, awarded TWA
and two other United States carriers
routes across the Atlantic through
Europe and the Middle East to the
Orient. Recently, the CAB in an or—
der just signed by the President has
awarded TWA permanent rights to
fly passengers and cargo from the
United States to Paris and Rome by
way of Ireland. In addition the CAB

destinations on another continent, now accessible by air in but a few hours.
TWA Constellations regularly fly back and forth across the Atlantic and across
the United States, covering 32,000 miles of routes through America, the British
Isles, Europe, the Middle East and India.
