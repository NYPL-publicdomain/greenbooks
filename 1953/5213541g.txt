Louisville’s parks ring the city in a
loose half-circle and include Iroquois,
Cherokee, Seneca and Shawnee. Cher-
okee, is a beautiful new park built
exclusively for Louisville’s Negro
residents and tourists. It is located
on Kentucky Lake near Eggner’s Fer-
ry Bridge, the route by which U. S.
68 crosses the lake. Louisville’s parks

.are individually typical of the Ken—

tucky Bluegrass country, the Ken~
tucky Knobs, and English meadow—
lands and are all noted for their
charm. Numerous smaller parks add
to the City’s recreational facilities
which include golf courses, 84 tennis
courts, 4 swimming pools, 34 baseball
diamonds, 12 playgrounds with an or—
ganized time progress for all ages,
an open-air theatre for theatricals and
pageants, numerous picnic areas and
48 miles of park drives and parkways
and bridle paths.

The Kentucky Derby

The famous Blue grass of Kentucky
derives its name from the bluish hue
imparted to the landscape by the color
of the seed vessels of the grass which
lies like a soft, thick mat on the un—
dulating surface of the hills and dales.

This exceptionally luxuriant vegeta-
tion which marks the country-side
nourishes the thoroughbred horses
whose reputation for speed and beauty
are world-wide.

Horses and horse farms probably
rank as the number one Tourist at-
traction because horse—racing is by all

odds Louisville’s most exciting sport. ‘

The spring and fall meets provide
something to see and add an extra
ﬁllip to conversation during the 29
days of racing each year, but the Ken-
tucky Derby is America’s foremost
horse—racing classic.

Colonel Lewis M. Clark, a promi-
nent local sportsman went to England
in 1872 and there, after viewing the
Epsom Derby formulated the idea of
inaugurating a race of like nature in
Louisville. He possessed a strong in-
clination for entertaining and upon
his return to America transformed his
living quarters at Churchill Downs
into a clubhouse. There, he elegantly
displayed the celebrated hospitality of
the South to his guests which through
the ensuing generations still has a
compelling appeal for all levels of
American society.

The ﬁrst Derby was run on the
seventeenth of May 1875 and was the
subject of much comment even from
New York papers. They reported a
crowd of 10,000 spectators and gave
special emphasis to the “dazzling ar-
ray of feminine loveliness.” The
Derby had its ups and downs, its tri-
als and tribulations during succeeding
years but gradually through reorgani-
zation and good management under
the direction of Colonel Matt Winn,
it achieved recognition as one of the
richest as well as the most romantic
stake race in the world.

For days before the annual event
all masculine talk in Louisville centers
around the condition of the horses,
the possibility of rain and the betting
