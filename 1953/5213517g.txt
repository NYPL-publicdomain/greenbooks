of commercial aviation itself and
shows the advance from a one-plane
service over the 90—mile route from
Key West to Havana to a world—wide
network of 60,000 route miles serving
71 countries. From the tiny beginning
of the Key West-to—Havana route,
Pan American has overcome the ob-
.stacle of intercontinental Air travel
with a rapid growth through Latin
America and eventual conquest of the
Paciﬁc and Atlantic.

Today, passenger lists Of the ﬁrst
trans—Atlantic ﬂights of the new low
fare service show conclusively that
revolution in American Vacation hab-
its is on the way. Thrifty, medium—
income Americans who had never
previously thought a trans-Atlantic
trip possible will soon be arriving in
Europe in large numbers, thus bring—
ing into sharp focus the social im—
pact of the 30 percent reduction in
‘ fares, which became effective on May
' 1. These new low fares have made it
' possible for business and military men

to have the companionship of their
families in the foreign countries
where their work has taken them.

The Company starts its services
with the only planes speciﬁcally de-
signed for comfortable, low-fare
ﬂights, the giant Super—6 Clippers with
accommodations for 82 passengers.
Pan American will be providing bet-
ter than two a day service each way
across the Atlantic with Super-6s di-
rect to eight cities in Europe and also
better than two a day on the deluxe
“President” double—deck Clipper serv—
ice. The round trip fare to London on
the tourist service, for example, is
$486 compared with $711 on the de-
luxe service.
