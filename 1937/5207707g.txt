DIVIDENDS

The average person“ buying a new car is eager to find out if the car is capable
of doing the things they have been told it will do.. Don’t allow your anxiety to cause

you to disregard the caution given by the manufacturer,

The breaking in of a new car is the most important factor in determining its
future performance. The greatest care and strict compliance with the instructions

given with the car must be adhered to,

Be patient during the first thousand miles of operation and you will later save

expense and this money saved will be the dividends on your new car investment.
