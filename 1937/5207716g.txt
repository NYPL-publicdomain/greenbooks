HOW TO KEEP FROM
GROWING OLD

I.

Always race with locomotive to
crossings. Engineers like it; it breaks
the monotony of their jobs.

Always pass the car ahead on
curves or turns. Don’t use horn, it

may unnerve the fellow and cause
him to turn out,too far.

Demand half the road—thle middle
half. Insist on your rights.

‘ Always speed; it shows them you
are a man of pep even tho an amateur
driver.

Never stop, look or listen at rail-
road crossings. It consumes time.

Always lock your brakes when
skidding. It makes thle job more
artistic.

In sloppy weather drive close to
pedestrians. Dry cleaners appreciate
this.

Never look around when you back
up; there is never anything behind
you.

Drive conﬁdently, just as tho there
were not eighteen million other cars
in service.
