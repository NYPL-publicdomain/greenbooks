Before going any further, may we take this opportunity to thank all
our readers for the success of the celebration of our 20th Anniversary.

best this year to please you.

is fervently hoped the situation will not get worse, curtailing the great
boom of foreign travel. Until the fear of war eases, we trust you will use

Indian areas.

Uncle Sam has lifted the 10 per cent transportation tax on all travel
to the West Indies, Mexico, Central America, Canada, Hawaii and Alaska.
The hoteliers and moteliers across this land and abroad are courting you
more than ever this season. Certain railroads have added what they term
their ‘secret weapon’——the Slumbercoach—to lure the long—haul coach
passenger from the tourist class airplanes and buses. Each Slumbercoach
has its own wash basin and toilet, air conditioning and heat control. Sea-

soned travelers will appreciate the fact that the plumbing functions with
