FOREWORD

Millions of people hit the road each year, to get away from
their old surroundings, to see and learn how people live, and
meet new and old friends.

Modern travel has given millions of people an opportunity 1
to see the wonders of the World. Thousands and thousands of '
dollars are spent each year on various modes of transportation.
Money spent in this manner brings added revenue to tradesmen
throughout the country.

The White traveler has had no difﬁculty in getting accom-
modations, but with the Negro it has been different. He, before
the advent of a Negro travel guide, had to depend on word
of mouth, and many times accommodations were not available.

Now things are different. The Negro traveler can depend
on the “GREEN BOOK” for all the information he wants, and
has a wide selection to choose from. Hence this guide has made
traveling more popular, without encountering embarrassing
situations.

We appreciate letters from the public telling us about
places that are not listed in the “GREEN BOOK.” We also
welcome your comments and opinions. We are now and shall
always continue to be interested in your welfare. Your co-
operation will enable us to reach the summit of our goal and
further our eﬁorts in giving “ASSURED PROTECTION FOR

THE NEGRO TRAVELER.”

*Denotes The Negro Travelers’ Green Book recommended Hotel, Motels, Tourist
Homes, etc.

(Omission of * does not necessarily mean inferior accommodations.)

The publishers make every effort to assure the accuracy of the “Green
Book” editorial information, and to maintain the high character of its
advertising pages. We cannot however, accept responsibility for inac-
curacies in editorial or advertising matter. Where rates are quoted, they

are subjject to change.
