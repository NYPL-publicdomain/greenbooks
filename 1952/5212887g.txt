largest French market —— which dis~
plays a bewildering selection of fruits
and vegetables. This market remains

Here one ﬁnds peoples of all classes
drinking coffee and rubbing elbows in
casual familiarity.

New Orleans is noted for the best
cuisine in the ,world, because her soil
produces many rare spices. The old
Creole women still sit on the gro'und
with a stone dish and mallet and
pound bay leaves for Feilee, a powder
used to make one type of Gumbo '—
a famous New Orleans dish.

New Orleans is a Catholic city hav~
ing a full week of, feast, festivities and
gayiety. It is wide open, anything is
allowed except murder which also
happens On Ash Wednesday all Of
the gay-iety turns into the most sacred
forty days of fasting and praying.
'some really believe the solemnity sur—
pases Rome, the Eternal Holy City.
There 18 no meat in the butcher shops
on High Holy Fast Days and no par-

ties in the homes without a City Hall
permit '

One of its famous institutions, its
, Mardi Gras (A Catholic Holiday which
marks the, coming of Lent) originated
in the French Quarter, masked balls
and street masking —— where costumes
of every discription may be seen;
some beautiful, others frightfully gro-
tesque, all worn in the spirit of fun.
At the stroke of mid- night on the day
of the festivities whiCh ends abruptly
—— the streets quickly clear and all be—

comes quiet and orderly —— for Lent
has begun.‘

To get: in one of the Mardi Gras
» Balls, thEy must know your grand,
parents and what they stood for. It
is much easier to get into Buckingham
Palace than it is to be- invited to the
Young Men's Illonois and the Old

. practice

question. The Bunches and Young Men

clubs of the city.

city authorities. It is a custom to
which the old citizens were and their
present descendents are, much attached.

and is participated in by all classes, and
is the only masked folk festival in the
United States.

churches presided over by members of

There are many drug stores that still
do illicit business in Voodoo powders,
and charms.
