EXPLANATION

No travel Guide is perfect! The changing conditions as all know, contribute
to this condition, particularly in the United States.

The listings in this Guide are carefully checked and, despite this, past eX-

periences have shown that our minute inspection had failed to notice errors which 5

would be an inconvenience to the traveller. Therefore, at this point may we em-

phasize that these listings are printed just as they are presented to us and we 1

would like your cooperation and understanding, that the publishers are not
responsible for miscalculations or errors after this check has been made.

We appreciate letters from you, our patrons, donating advice and addresses
of places not listed herein, that would be in accord with our level. We also wel-
come adverse critisism, in that, it might improve our'standards, and, in the end,
afford more comfortable conditions for you and others.

This Guide Book is not sold on newsstands but in bookstores. They make
appreciative gifts to friends and neighbors. Inasmuch as the sale of these Guide
Books depend mostly upon the friend-to-fri'end oral advertising system, it
would be particularly interesting if more of our patrons would pass the word
along concerning our “Green Book”.

For further information concerning this matter you may contact our agents

or the publishers: Victor H. Green 8 Co., Leonia, N. J.
