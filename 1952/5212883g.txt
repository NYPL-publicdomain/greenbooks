The city which is distinguished from
other American cities by its semi-
tropical climate, its historical heritage,
and its French Quarter, is located 110
miles from the mouth of the Missis-
sippi River. The river being largely
responsible for the founding of the
city —- making New Orleans the trad-
ing post of the entire Mississippi val~
ley; the river provided the harbor

which along with its proximity to the
Mexican Gulf and the World’s sea

lanes, enabled it to vie for the position
of one of the foremost American ports,
leading up to becoming the capitol of
the United States trade with Latin
5 America.

New Orleans is only one foot above
sea level, and is several feet below the
high water level of the Mississippi.
Only its levees, keep the river from

washing away. However, after. the .
ﬂood of 1927 the Bonnett Carre'.
Spillway was constructed a few miles
above the city, so that now —- when-
ever the river threatens the artiﬁcial
banks that keep it harnessed, the
gates of the Spillway are, opened and
the excess water is diverted into Lake
Pontchartrain north of the city, from
which it ﬁnds its way into the Gulf.

New Orleans has its rainfall prob-
lems. The city’s annual precipitation.
is greater than that of any other large

city in the United States, except Mo-
bile and Miami.

Since natural drainage is non-exist-
ant, huge pumps located in pumping
stations at strategic points, are used
to keep the city habitable.
