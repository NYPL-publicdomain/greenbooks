COURTYARD — NEW ORLEANS

Here is a corner of one of New Orleans’ many charming outdoor courtyards found in the celebrated

French Quarter. The crumbling brick walls and clinging vines offer mute reminder of the colorful
days gone by.

Many of the courtyards are open for tourists inspection and these fragrant bits of gardens
scattered about the old city are ever a source of interest to visitors.
