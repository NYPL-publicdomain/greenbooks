How TO KEEP FROM
GROWING OLD

Always race with locomotive to
crossing. Engineers like it; it breaks
the monotony of their jobs.

Always pass the car ahead on
curves or turns. Don't use horn, it
may unnerve the fellow and cause
him to turn out too far.

Demand half the road —— the middle
half. Insist on your rights.

Always speed; it shows them you
are a man of pep even tho an amateur
driver. '

Never stop, look or listen at rail—
road crossings. It consumes time.

Always lock your brakes when skid—
ding. It makes the job more artistic.

In sloppy weather drive close to
pedestrians. Dry cleaners appreciate

this.

Never look around when you back
up; there is never anything behind
you.

Drive confidently, just as tho there
were not eighteen million other cars
in service.

aim.

Thousands of Motorists are being killed each year on our roads.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL — Your loved ones would like to keep
you for a long time.
