PLEASE MENTION "THE GREEN BOOK"

As a group we need more hotels and kindred services, as we constitute a
substantial segment of the traveling public. Because the places of accom-
modation to adequately serve this tremendous volume of potential business are
Still too few in number, it is all the more necessary that homes, hotels, etc.
open to serve us, should be known.

JAMES A. JACKSON (SEATED) AND WENDEL P. ALSTON. SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE ESSO MARKETERS IN THEIR NEW YORK OFFICE

Thatâ€™s why Esso is glad to make our customers acquainted with the Green
Book which enables them to go farther with less anxiety and more pleasure,
thereby obtaining greater satisfaction from their travel and making more
amiable patrons of our own business of supplying gasoline and lubricating oils
for their tours when in our territory.

With Esso products, your car will take you there and bring you back, while
the Green Book tells you where you may stop while there. Bless the Green
Book and its service.

When contemplating a trip, you should write Victor H. Green, 200 West
135th St., New York City for his Green Book, and to the Esso Touring Service

for road maps and route directions.
