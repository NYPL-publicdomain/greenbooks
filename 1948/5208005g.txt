ABE JENKINS. NOTED RACING
DRIVER, IS SHOWN JOUNCING THE
“CR‘ADLED IN RUBBER” KELLER
SUPER-CHIEF AUTO AT ITS SPECIAL
SHOWING IN THE HOTEL PENNSYL-
VANIA IN NEW YORK. THIS NEW
ENTRY IN THE SMALL-CAR FIELD-
92 INCH WHEEL BASE— HAS ALL
FOUR WHEELS INDIVIDUALLY SUS-
PENDED IN A VERSION OF THE B. F.
GOODRICH TORSILASTIC SPRING
(THE TORSION ARM OF THE LEFT-
REAR SPRING IS THE WHITE, FLAT
MEMBER DIRECTLY BELOW JENKINS'
HAND). THE STRIPPED CHASSIS
SHOWN HERE IS ONE ON WHICH
THE ENGINE IS MOUNTED IN THE
REAR: THE RADIATOR ACTUALLY
FACES THE REAR OF THE CAR BUT
IS MOUNTED AT THE SIDE OF THE
MOTOR. A STATION WAGON AND A
“TRUE” CONVERTIBLE" WERE ALSO

SHOWN.

W'—

The wheels are pulled gently over
bumps instead of being pushed abrupt-
ly into them.

Keller Motors Corporation comes
to town establishing a post war pre-
cedent in that they brought for their
showing a multi-colored, attractive
rear engine mounted show chassis—
a tulip cream and green colored
show convertible and a station
wagon, making a very attractive
showing at the Hotel Pennsylvania.

They are placing much emphasis
on the “cradled in rubber” feature
and' have a test chassis in their ex-
hibit to show exactly how the spring
action works. This chassis has trav-
eled many thousands of miles and
hauled hundreds of different people.

Their engineers have developed a
very ingenious method for setting the
engine fore and aft. The convertible
carries the engine mounted in the rear.
A model to come later will be a
Package Delivery Car, an ultra-
swanky unit for light deliveries. This
model will carry engine in the rear—
with package compartment in large
front space where engines are usually
located. Only one seat is provided
for driver.

L'7'N"E‘ " 0F MODELS

Keller Motors Corporation has al-
ready acquired facilities for produc-
tion of Station Wagon Bodies com-
plete. Officials are planning early
production of this model ahead of
the Convertible, because with com-
pletted station wagon bodies, Kirkv
site dies can be used in forming the
sheet metal for the front end of this
model because there is much less
sheet metal used on this car. Mean-
while work will progress rapidly on
the dies for metal body parts of the
convertible back of the windshield,
and also on permanent dies for all
Cars.
