PLEASE MENTION

The brakes are the single disc
type, similar to those used to stop
fast landing military planes without
skid or turn. Conventional shoe brakes
operate with a high frequency succes-
sion of grabs and releases. When an
emergency stop must be made, passen-
gers are thrown forward. With the
Tucker brakes, however, there is a
gradual and increasing application of
friction. Even on fast stops, passen-
gers will not be thrown dangerously
forward. The brakes are aluminum,
are air—cooled and have 21/2 times
the braking surface of those on con-
ventional cars.

Wheels of the Tucker‘48 are sus-
pended individually. Two flat arms
are fastened to each wheel, cushioned
in rubber, which permits absorption
of shocks at their source. This System
tends to eliminate any tendency for
the car to weave at touring speeds.

It is almost impossible to skid the
Tucker, either when braking or apply—
ing power, regardless of the weather
conditions. The over-all design dis—
tributes weight to give precision bal-
ance and insures complete four wheel
traction in braking.

Safety is the keynote of design in
the Tucker car. Engineers carefully
studied accident records and designed
the car for maximum protection
against unavoidable smash—ups. For
example, the record showed 90 percent
of all collisions are slanting blows.
So the frame of the Tucker ‘48 was
built to completely surround the pas-
senger compartment.

Danger spots in conventional auto-

mobiles also include the windshield
and the instrument panel, which are
responsible for 85 percent of all face
injuries. In the Tucker car, the con-
ventional instrument panel is replaced
with an attractive sponge rubber crash
board cowl. All the driving instru-

ments are located on the steering col-
umn itself.

The Tucker windshield is made of
safety glass, mounted in a rubber
fastening. A hard blow from within
will knock it out in one piece. If the
glass should break, it won’t shatter
into sharp, cutting slivers, but into
small gravel—like pieces.

A spacious luggage compartment
is found in the front of the car-the
space occupied by engines on conven-
tional cars. A safety steel bulkhead
behind this compartment shields the
passenger compartment from head—on
collisions far more effectively than the
conventional front engine. The driver
and front seat passengers can drop
into a spacious safety chamber pro-
tected by the steel bulkhead in the
event of an impending collision.

The Tucker ‘48, although it has a
128-inch wheelbase and an overall
length of 210 inches, weighs but about
3,000 pounds because of an extensive
use of aluminum in body and engine
consruction.

The car stands about 601/2 inches
from road to roof, but has 38 inches
of head room in the front seat and
36 inches of clearance in the rear
seat.

The front tread of the Tucker ‘48
is 62 inches and the rear is 65 inches.

The Tucker ‘48 is being built in one
of the largest factories in the world,
the plant which formerly produced
B-29 engines on Chicago’s far south
side. It was acquired from the War
Assets Administration by the Tucker
Corporation a few months afer the
government began disposing of its sur-
plus war property.

Assembly line production is sched-
uled to begin about April I.
