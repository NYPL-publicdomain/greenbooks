Dear Sir;  .

It is a great pleasure for me to give credit where credit is due. Many

of my friends have joined me in admittng that. “The Negro Motorists,
i
Green Book" is, a credit to the Negro Race. It is a book badly needed;
among our Race since the advance of the motor age. Realizing the only‘
way we knew where and how to reach our pleasure resorts was in a way”?
of speaking, by word of mouth, until the publication of “The Negro
Motorist Green book”. With our wishes of your success, and your ernestgi
efforts. We earnestly believe “The Negro Motorist Green Book” will mean L 

i s

as much if not more to us as the A. A. A. means to the white race.

Respectfully Yours,

W 111. Smith.
