A new express lilighway, The Merritt
Parkway, about 4H miles in length
connecting with the Hutchii‘xson River
Parkway in New York State will
carry one clear on the other side. of
Norwalk and connect with Route N0. 1
the old Boston Post Road. By using
this road one will eliminate the necess-
ity of going through so many small
towns in Connecticut and being held
up by lights. This highway has been
completed thus far and in time Will
take one into Boston Mass. .
Motorists traveling from the South
01‘ West going to the New England
States on reaching New ‘i'ork by way
of the Holland Tunnel or the Geo
\Vashington Bridge can use the \Vest
Side express Highway Connecting with
the New Hendrick Hudson Parkway,
north on Saw Mill River Parkway and
at the Hawthorne Circle connect with
the Hutchinson River Parkway and
then the Merritt Parkway. By using:
these routes one ﬁnds very few lights
and doesn't have to enter any of the
towns, hence much time will he saved.
