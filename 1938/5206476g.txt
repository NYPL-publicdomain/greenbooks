BAD DRIVING WASTES FUEL

cape

With the high tax on gasoline in the different states, it behoves
all motorists to‘get the most out of his car. This is particularly true
of the newest cars because of their great capacity for performance.
Many driving customs should be revised when driving for milage with
the modern car. With the automatic choke, if the car is backed out of the
driveway, it shouldn’t be left running; but switched off. If this pre—
caution is not observed the engine will load up and cause the wasting

of a lot of gas.

More and more drivers shoot their machines up to 20 miles per
hour in low and more than 30 in second. Also this spurt in low gears
serves no good purpose at all. As soon as the car is rolling along easily
in low it should be shifted to second. This same rule should be appleed

when shifting from second to high.

The good care that you give your car regularly also plays an
important part. New spark plugs, keeping the ignition timing up to its
highest point of efficiency will cause improvement. The proper lubrica—
tion is important and the right oil in the crank case. The oil ﬁlter is
important so that the engine doesn’t suffer from increased wear. T‘ires

should be well inﬂated and seeing that the brakes don’t drag.

Clutch slippages also wastes fuel. The braking of a car causes
the lost of fuel as the brakes shouldn’t be applied suddenly when ap—
proaching a traffic light or halting for an emergency. One should always

be on the watch for same as it requires added fuel to build up momentum.
