HOW TO KEEP FROM
GROWING OLD
Always race with locomotive to

Crossings. Engineers like it; it; :
it breaks the monotony of their jobs. l

Always pass the car ahead on curves i.

or turns. Don’t use horn, it may un-

nerve the fellow and cause him to turn 1 V

outout too far.

Demand half the roadwthe middle
half. Insist on your rights.

Always speed; it shows them
are a man of pep even the
amateur driver.

you

Never Stop, look or listen at railroad  g

crossings. lt consumes time.

Always lock your brakes when skid-
:ling. It makes the job more artistic.

In Sloppy weather drive close to
pedestrians. Dry cleaners appreciate

this. .

Never look around when you back
up; there is never anything behind
you.

Drive confidently, just as tho there
were not eighteen million other cars
in service.
