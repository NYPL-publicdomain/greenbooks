SAFE DRIVING RULES

Watch out for the drvier who crosses the White Line.

When the other car passes you, watch out that he doesn’t cut
in on you. '

Watch out for the driver who doesn’t know any better than to pass
on a hill.

Even when the light is Green, look out for the reckless driver com-
ming from left or right, who is ignorant that the Red light is

against him.

Watch the driver ahead —— you can’t be sure whether or not he’ll
signal when he turns.

Even on highways, look out for parked cars.

Watch the car comming down the steep hilltowards you. Maybe
the driver doesn’t know enough to go into second.

Don’t assume that the other fellow has good breakes.

At night look out for pedestrains walking on your side of the
highway.

On Icy Roads look out! Some drivers don’t know any better than
to brake suddenly on ice.

Going over a hill, be ready for drivers who may be fools hardly
as to make a turn across the road.

When you are passing, look out for the car that may be suddenly
pulling out to pass just ahead of you.

Maybe the cop won’t catch the car that passes you at 80, but
“sudden death” is liable to.

On a three lane highway, watch out for the driver who thinks the
middle lane is his exclusively.

Remember that Junior thinks, that the ignition key is something to
play with.
