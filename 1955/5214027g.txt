One of the things our founding
fathers considered important to this
nation’s welfare was the “pursuit
of happiness.”

Happiness is an estate that every
human heart seeks to attain but, un—
fortunately, most of us attempt to
pursue it in a circle and like a
squirrel in a cage we don’t get any-
where. '

A few years ago, a New Orleans
disk jockey was unhappy. He
thought everything and everybody
but himself was wrong. He tried to
ﬁnd happiness in a bottle. The
harder he tried the further he found
himself from his objective.

Some of his friends who had
bought happiness by the same route
and found that it led up a blind
alley, talked his problem over with
him and urged him to join the
organization known as “Alcoholics
Anonymous.”

Through the organization he
learned the importance of helping
others as a means of helping your-
self. He began working at it in
earnest. He found that for the ﬁrst
time in his life he was really happy.
A man he had pulled out of the
gutter and put on his feet came to
him and with tears in his eyes, tried
to thank him for what he had done.
“Forget it,” he said, “I’m the guy
who should be doing the thanking;
the privilege of helping you gave
me more happiness than you’ll ever
know.” It was an even exchange.

That was the beginning of “Big
Joe’s Happiness Exchange Founda-
tion,” a non—proﬁt charitable or—
ganization that has helped thousands
of people in hundreds of ways. Joe
Rosenﬁeld, Jr. inaugurated a radio
program designed to foster the ex—
change of happiness.

He invited listeners to tell him

their troubles and offered to do
what he could to help solve them.
Letters and phone calls told of an
avalanche of unhappiness.
became interested in what J'oe was

trying to do. They volunteered to

investigate cases, assist him for the
“fun of it.”

Wheel—chairs and crutches seemed
to develop out of thin air, books
and stamps came for veterans and
shut-ins, food for the hungry, clothes
for the naked, radios and phono—
graphs, toys and theatre tickets,
“Big Joe” became one of the best
loved men in New Orleans.

Then the programs were moved
to [New York where his ﬁeld was
tremendously broadened. It devel-

oped from a radio program to a

foundation. Others wanted to get in f‘
on the act and would sit in on Joe’s V
program, answering telephone calls }

and letters, distributing gifts, inves—

tigating cases, all on a volunteer'

basis.
Joe’s program is featured on Ra—

dio Station W.M.G.M., New York,
from midnight to 2:00 A.M. (1050
on your dial) and has recorded
listeners from Canada to Florida and
as far West as the Mississippi
River.

Becoming interested in drug ad-
dicts “Big Joe” organized DAA,
Drug Addicts Anonymous, pat-

terned after Alcoholics Anonymous, I

afﬁliated with the Happiness EX-
change Foundation, Inc. Hundreds

of unfortunates have been helped ,

and the program is being expanded.

“Big Joe” doesn’t want large
contributions. He contends that hap-
piness should be shared, not hogged.
Once. a wealthy man offered him
one thousand dollars following a
particular appeal, “Big Joe” refused
