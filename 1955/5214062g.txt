BERMUDA

Out in the Mid-Atlantic, south
east of the Virginia Capes, beyond
the Gulf Stream’s ﬂying ﬁsh and
phosphorus, lie the most famous
coral islands in the World. it is the
Bermudas . . . less than 20 square
miles in size and so formed that in
few spots is it possible to get more
than a mile away from the sea. The

north and south shores are utterly

diﬁerent and might belong to coun-
tries hundreds of leagues apart.

The Bermudas, with startling
clarity of sunlight, their gentle
tropical sea, their special ﬂash of
white—washed roofs, pink-tinted
walls and ﬂaming poinciana trees,
and their island nights glittering
with more stars than any other sky
in the Atlantic. They are collectively
called “Bermuda.” Here we ﬁnd a
place of coveted ease, unhurried
charm and relaxed living._

Here it may mean building castles
in the cleanest pink and white sand
on earth, wandering over coral
beaches into ocean that is the green-
est green, the bluest blue. It may
mean cycling along South Shore
Road between tall hedges of Ole-
ander, with youngster and picnic
lunches safely tucked in a basket
on handle bars.

Or it may be the velvety greens
and fairways of one of Bermuda’s
many golf courses. Or where attrac—
tive shops show choicest merchan-
dise of the British Empire.

There are many beautifully kept
tennis courts, hidden picnic beaches,
delightful roads and coral rocks
from which a native ﬁsherman’s
net may be cast,,ensnaring every-
thing including prancing sea-horses
and mermaids singing! For, like a
jewel set in Mid-Atlantic, Bermuda
is the wish at sunset and romance
is starlight-

 

HOW DO I GET TO

BERMUDA?
You go from one Parish to an—

other by boat, by bicycle, by the
small motor car. Everywhere the
place is leisurely. The motor car,
convenient for visits from one end
of the islands to the other, travels
(by law) only a few miles faster
than average horse and carriage.

You ﬂy by the latest aircraft or
