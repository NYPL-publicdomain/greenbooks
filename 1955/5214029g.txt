His name’s RAY CARROLL.
Instead of a “lantern,” he carries
a stack of records! In place of a
“key,” he uses ’a WMCA micro-
phone; And he makes the “rounds”
of New York’s air waves from 2:00
to 6:00 A.M. every night but Sun—
day! To thousands of Metropolitan
night owls, Watchman Carroll is a
pleasant, happy—go—lucky guy who
plays the music they want to hear
(including special requests) . .

chats with them on the telephone
. and, for hours, makes life and
work—seem a little easier and a
lot more fun! During his musical
“tour of duty,” Ray runs the gamut
of recorded favorites—from the
latest jukebox hits to the tunes on
the “all—time great” lists—choosing
the discs from his tremendous pri—
vate collection with a true music
lover’s appreciation of what makes
the best wee—hour listening. That
record collection, incidentally, is the
product of more than ten years of
late—night musical broadcasting.

MEET NEW YORK’S ”NIGHT WATCHMAN”

“Willie & Ray” duo conducting an

“After Hours Session” nightly over -

Station WHOM. Several years with
WHOP, Hopkinsville, Kentucky,
WBYN and VVVVRL—New York,
and the Armed Forces Radio Serv-

ice, round out the broadcasting €X-‘

perience of this veteran 34—year—old
entertainer. A graduate of Brook—

lyn’s Boys’ High and New York

University, Ray is married, has a

seven—year—old son, and is an en—
thusiastic golfer when radio isn‘t
crowding his busy schedule. He also
does an occasional
“Rhythm _& Blues” magazine and

participates in such community ac— ‘
tivities as the recent series of Voca— ‘
tional Guidance Lectures for young
people at one of Manhattan’s Com— i
munity Centers. Needless to add, it. P
sense of‘
humor and a relaxed, easy—does—it
nature to keep pace with this disc

takes a well—developed

jockey’s schedule and fortunately
Ray is blessed with both. Which
probably explains why Ray Carron
is one of the few people who can

keep New Yorkers awake nights-—

and make them like it!
