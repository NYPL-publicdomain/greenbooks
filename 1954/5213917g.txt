Francisco is wrapped in atmosphere of
enchantment.

San Francisco was once a barren
stretch of sand dunes and rocky hills,
scattered with swamps and lagoons.
In order to provide for its increasing
populations its valleys, tidal marshes
and lagoons have been ﬁlled in and
its smaller hills leveled. Today, San
Francisco is a city that is largely
man—made. The city’s famed bridges
have united San Francisco with its
neighboring municipalities, blending
them into one metropolitan area.
These bridges consist of two suspen—
sions and one cantilever which when
combined, covers over eight miles in
length and adds up to the largest
bridge structure yet built. The Golden
Gate Bridge regarded as the most
l‘eautiful bridge structure is also the
longest single suspension span in the
world. By walking out on itfor the
price of one dime the tourist can
behold this bridge in all its majesty.
The San Francisco—Oakland Bay
Bridge cannot be seen in this manner
though none of its splendor is lost
in Viewing it from the harbor on a
Southern Paciﬁc ferryboat.

Though, the bridges have contrib—
uted to their economic and social
growth the neighboring communities
resent becoming known as San Fran-
cisco’s bedrooms. Oakland which is
California’s third largest city is in
the same unfavorable position as New
York City’s, Brooklyn. Industries and
assembly plants have turned Oak—
land into a Western Detroit. Its out-
standing symbol of activity is the
Latham Square Building, headquar—
ters for Henry Kaiser’s vast indus—
trial empire. This city has the larg—
est Negro population on the Paciﬁc
Coast.

The University of California is lo-
cated in Berkeley, the town adjoining

Oakland. With more than forty thou—
sand students attending classes on the
eight, scattered campuses of the Uni-
versity, Berkeley still manages to be
tidy, serene and cordial. It comes
closest to achieving the cosmopolitan
ease desired by other communities
because of its casual acceptance of
people regardless of their race, creed
or color.

San Francisco however, is fast be—
coming the focal point of the Negroes’
future. Before World War II this
city had fewer than 5,000 Negroes.
High war wages attracted these peo—
ple from all over the country to this
boom town. More than 45,000 Neg—
roes are squeezed into two areas of

,San Francisco today, with an esti—

13

mated thirty—ﬁve per cent unemployed.
Though, comfortable housing facilities
and business opportunities are limited
to Negroes at this time, tribute should
be paid to the encouraging attitude
held by San Franciscans toward the
improvement and eventual erasure of
these existing conditions. They pride
themselves on living in the most cul-
tured, cosmopolitan and liberal com-
