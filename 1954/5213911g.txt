EXPLANATION

No travel Guide is perfect! The changing conditions as all know,
contribute to this condition, particularly in the United States.

The listings in this Guide are carefully checked and, despite this,
. past experiences have shown that our minute inspection had failed to
notice errors which would be an inconvenience to the traveler. There—
fore, at this point may we emphasize that these listings are printed
‘ just as they are presented to us and we would like your cooperation

' and understanding, that the publishers are not responsible for miscal—
' culations or errors after this check has been made.

We appreciate letters from you, our patrons, donating advice
and addresses of places not listed herein, that would be in accord
with our level. We also welcome adverse criticism, in that, it might
improve our standards, and, in the end, afford more comfortable
conditions for you and others. i

This Guide Book is not sold on newsstands but in bookstores.
They make appreciative gifts to friends and neighbors. Inasmuch as
the sale of these Guide Books depend mostly upon the friend—to—friend
oral advertising system, it would be particularly interesting if more
of our patrons would pass the word along concerning our “Green
Book.”
