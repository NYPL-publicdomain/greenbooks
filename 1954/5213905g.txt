A Chat With The Editor

RAVELING is one of the large in-

dustries of this era. Millions of

people hit the road as soon as
the warm weather sets in. They want
to get away from their old surround—
ings: to see—to learn how people live
——to meet old and new friends.

In this era of the automobile, trains,
buses, boats and fast ﬂying air liners,
we have an assortment of transporta—
tion which will take one to any place
that they might wish to go. With all
of these transportation facilities at
has brought
thousands of people out of their
homes to View the wonders of the
world.

Thousands and thousands of dol-
' lars are spent each year in the various
modes of transportation. Money spent
like this brings added revenue to
trades people throughout the country.

, The white traveler for years has
had no difﬁculty in getting accomoda—
tions, but with the Negro it has been
different. He before the advent of
Negro Travel Guides has had to de—
pend on word of mouth and then
sometimes accommodations weren’t
available. But now a days things are
different—he has his own travel guide,
that he can depend on for all the
information that he wants and with a

selection. Hence these guides have
made traveling more popular. and
without running into embarrassing
situatiOns.

Since 1936, THE GREEN BOOK
has been published yearly. A few
years after its publication, THE
GREEN BOOK was recognized as
the ofﬁcial Negro Travel Guide by the
United States Travel Bureau, a part
of the Department of Commerce,
which bureau has been closed, due
to the lack of funds. By being such
an important piece of literature, white
business has also recognized its value
and it is now in use by the Esso
Standard Oil Co., The American
Automobile Assn. and its afﬁliate au—
tomobile clubs throughout the coun—
try, other automobile clubs, 'air lines,
travel bureaus, travelers aid, libraries
and thousands of subscribers.

Hence we have ﬁlled one of our
life’s ambitions, to give the Negro a
travel guide that will be of service to
him, by this method we have estab—
lished ourselves in the minds of the
traveling public. THE GREEN
BOOK is known from coast to coast
as the source of information for travel
and vacations.
