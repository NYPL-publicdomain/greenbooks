OCEAN BEACH AT SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA
San Francisco meets the Paciﬁc Ocean on a long white beach, which extends some three and a half
miles between the Cliff House and Flei‘hhyacker Zoo. It is skirted by the Esplanade and the Great

Highway; ﬂanked by Playland—at-the—Beach and Golden Gate Park. Here people wade into waves
from China; cast in the surf for striped bass and other ﬁsh; bask around picnic ﬁres on the sand;

point their cars west and watch the sea, and ships or a sunset; enjoy entertainment at the playland
Golden Gate Park extends from here four miles to the center of the city.
