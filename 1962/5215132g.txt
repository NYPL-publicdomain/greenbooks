New York, the largest city in the
United States and the second largest
in the world, is in southeastern New
York State, at the mouth of the Hud-
son River. Washington, D. C., is 230
miles south, Miami 1,340 miles south
and Los Angeles 2,875 miles west. New York has had a colorful history,
starting with its discovery by Henry Hudson at the beginning of the 17th
Century. In 1926, the Dutchman, Peter Minuit, made one of the most remark-
able real estate deals in history when he purchased Manhattan Island from
the Indians for a reported $24 worth of trinkets; real estate values have
increased considerably since then. Sponsored by the Dutch West India
Company, the young colony, called New Amsterdam, got off to a good start
and because of its excellent location as a seaport, prospered immediately.
In 1664, in support of complicated territorial claims, the English seized the
settlement and renamed it New York in honor of Britain's Duke of York.
In return, the Dutch were given a free hand in Surinam, which the English
had begun to colonize. War broke out again between Britain and the Dutch
Republic and in 1673 a Dutch fleet returned to New York and captured it,
renaming it Fort Orange. At the cease of the war in 1674, the town was
relinquished to Britain under whose rule it prospered once more. During
the American Revolution, New York remaind in British hands until the end

and it was there that George Washington was inaugurated as first President

'of the United States. Today the city is perhaps the greatest port in the

.world and the financial, intellectual and artistic center of the Nation.
