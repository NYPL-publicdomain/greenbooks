HAYDEN PLANETARIUM

Sunday is a good day for a visit to the Hayden Planetarium (85th St.
and Central Park West), where you can see an extremely interesting show
for a modest charge of about 75¢. The entire performance takes about one
hour and is definitely worthwhile. Phone before going there to check on

starting time.
