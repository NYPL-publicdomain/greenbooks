 

HOW TO KEEP FROM
GROWING OLD

Always race with locomotive to
Crossings. Engineers like it; It;
breaks the monotony of their jobs.

Always pass the car ahead on curves
or turns. Don’t use horn, it may un-
nerve the fellow and cause him to turn

out too far.

Demand half the road—the middle
half. Insist on your rights.

it shows them you
even tho an

Always speed;
are a man of pep
amateur driver.

Never Stop, look or listen at railroad
crossings. It consumes time.

Always lock your brakes when skid-
ding. It makes the job more artistic.

In Sloppy weather drive close to
pedestrians. Dry cleaners appreciate

this.

Never look around when you back
up; there is never anything behind

you.

Drive confidently, just as tho there
were not eighteen million other cars
in service.
