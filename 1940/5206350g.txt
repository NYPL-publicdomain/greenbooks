Dear Sir;

It is a great pleasure for me to give credit where credit is due. Many
. if my friends have joined me in admitting that. “The Negro Motorist
Green Book” is a credit to the Negro Race. It is a book badly needed
among our Race since the advance of the motor age. Realizing the only
way we knew where and how to reach our pleasure resorts was in a way
of speaking, by word of mouth, until the publication of “The Negro
Motorist Green Book.” With our wishes of your success, and your earnest
efforts. We earnestly believe “The Negro Motorist Green Book” will mean

as much if not more to us as the A. A. A. means to the white race.

Respectfully Yours,

Wm. Smith.
