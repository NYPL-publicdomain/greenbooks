 

PLEASE MENTION “THE GREEN BOOK”

Here in Beaufort is a large house, formerly the home of Robert A.
Small, (Negro) the famous blockade runner cf the Civil War. At Fort
Pulaski National Monument, at the mouth of the Savannah River, we
ﬁnd what is probably the largest ﬁg tree in the world. It has a spread of
170 feet. It is 32 feet high and the yearly average production is 50
bushels of ﬁgs. Thirteen miles south of the City of Savannah is located
the United States Department of Agriculture Bamboo propagation farm,
and a short distance further at Ways Station, Georgia, Mr. Henry Ford
has established his 70,000 acre model community. We learned of the
friendly gnterest he has shown in Cocoanut Grove.

lSpeeding north through Dixie, you do not open the coach windows
now for a breath of air and an eyeful of cinders. On a curve, every now
and then, we could glance ahead through the clear glass and see the
Seaboard’s huge yellow diesel “on the job”. How different!
