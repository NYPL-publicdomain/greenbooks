By GEORGE W. SHEPPARD

The fastest growing town in the
state of Illinois is one that is OWNED
AND OPERATED BY NEGROES.*
It is Robbins, Illinois, located seven-
teen miles from Chicago. Ninety-ﬁve
per cent of the more than six thousand

inhabitants OWN THEIR OWN
HOMES.

But Robbins is no “Boom Town.” It
was founded in 1917 by Thomas J.
Kellar and has since experienced a
slow but sure growth.

It owes the rapid strides it is mak-
ing at present to a number of factors.
First, perhaps, is the fact that the city
of Chicago, like most cities, has an
acute housing shortage and its inhab-
itants, looking for places to live, have

been attracted by the many advantages v

that Robbins- offers.

Secondly, the town is a f‘natural”
as a resort. It affords many picnic
grounds and is an ideal place for
summer outings. Many lakes are close
by and inhabitants claim that ﬁshing
is good too.

Thirdly, the courage, the foresight
and ability of the present mayor,
Holis L. Reeves, is bringing good,
sound, practical business into the local
government. In that way the village
is in a good position to cope with the
many problems that a fast growing
community must face. He is ably as-
sisted by Misses Bertha L. Hendricks,
deputy clerk, and Bessie M. Stephens,
secretary to the administration. Wil-
liam March is chief of police with
thirteen patrolmen working under his
direction. Milton A. Robinson is chief
of detectives.

The village is run by six trustees in
addition to the mayor. They are

Fletcher Tillman, DeWitt Williams,
Joseh Moore, Lee Riston and Victor
Anderson. Together they have guided '
the destinies of the community for the
last eight years.

National Leaders Started in R0be

Edward A. Starks, a business man
in Robbins for 4I years, recalls that
Herman E. Moore, new Federal judge
of the Virgin Islands, served as Vil-
lage attorney.

William L. Dawson, congressman
from the First Illinois District, also ,

served the Village as attorney. Mr. V ‘

Stark states that they helped to set f’,
up the legal machinery for the town i
and that the village owes them a debt 
of gratitude. Legal business and the
courts are conducted by one elected
judge, Ernest Lemon; Village attorney.
Today there is little crime in Rob-
bins.

No Prejudice and Restrictions -

The change that the visitor sees in ,
Robbins now is only of population
but of industry. Where there were
shelters covered with tar paper, there

are homes built of stone, concrete and- . 

marble. Water is supplied from the

city of Chicago and efforts are being.

made to increase the supply. Because
of the absence of prejudice and re~
strictions, opportunities for the Negro
are uhlimited.

There are ten churches of various
denominations, one centrally located
school of which William E. Jackson is
principal and a community high school
in the adjoining city of Blue Island.
There are sixty places of business ‘
and two physicians who serve Rob- .
bins; Dr. Waurice Winston, county
physician ad Dr. Williams. The Rev.
