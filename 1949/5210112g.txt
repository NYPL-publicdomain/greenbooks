A- precedent has been established in
the low-priced automotive ﬁeld by
combining handsomeness and beauty
with durability and comfort in the
interiors of the 1949 Ford cars.

Ford has broken away from the
neutral tones which have been tradi-
tional for mass production automo-
biles as designers have turned to tex-
tured fabrics popular in fashions and
interior deco-rating.

Of the three new fabrics, the most
unusual is a soft gray tweed mixture
with a blue stripe which gives the
1949 Ford interiors a freshly tailored
look. It has been combined with all
bolster of blue-gray broadcloth to pro.
tect the upper section of both front
and rear seats.

The clock dial has been centered
on the panel and placed higher. Night
glare is. eliminated on all instruments
by “black lighting.”

Chrome trim throughout the car has
been reduced. On the panel it is ex-
pressed in a neat arrangement of
uniform knobs which control choke,
windshield wiper, lights, heater and
defroster. ‘

On each door, the chrome strip
makes a decorative arc over the heavy
artiﬁcial leather kick pad at the bot-
tom. Flame-shaped center pillar lights
provide plenty of illumination for the
interior and for stepping into and out
of the car.

The same tailored good looks are
obtained with the other fabrics — a
smooth green striped broadcloth and
two new adaptations of mohair in a
green and maroon stripe and green
and gray stripe combination. In proper
combination, they complement the new
Ford exterior colors such as Sea Mist
Green, Birch Gray, Arabian Green
and Bayview Blue.

The instrument panel of the new
Ford has been simpliﬁed. All instru-
ments are combined in a single cluster
directly in line with the driver’s view.
Projecting slightly for better visibility,
the large ﬁgures on a telescoped dial
indicate speed, fuel level, rate of bat-
tery charge and oil pressure.

Interior door handles pull up in-
stead of down to open the door. This
eliminates the possibility of the car
doors swinging open if the handle
should be- pressed down accidentally.

The new Ford’s functionalism has
been extended to the roomy seats—57
inches wide in front and 60 inches in

the rear, plenty of room for six per-
sons.

New windows demonstrate the new
trend. The rear window alone is 88
per cent largerwas large as the ordi-
nary windshield. The windshield is
deeper and wider. They give a pic-
ture window effect to the entire car

and greatly improve all around visi-
bility.
