OF THE ESSO MARKETERS IN THEIR NEW YORK OFFICE

Numerous religious, sorority and fraternity groups travel constantly
through the year to quarterly or annual conferences—all faced with the prob-

lem of ﬁnding suitable places to stay, places to eat and the convenience and
comforts Which all travelers need and desire.

The GREEN BOOK with its list of hotels, boarding houses, restaurants,
beauty shops, barber shops and various other services can most certainly help
solve your travel problems. It was the idea of Victor H. Green, the publisher,
in introducing the Green Book, to save the travelers of his race as many
difficulties and embarrassments as possible.

The many requests we receive for information about it convince us that
he has done much to ease the anxieties of the average Negro traveler.

As representatives of the Esso Standard Oil Co., we are pleased to recom-
mend the GREEN BOOK for your travelvconvenience. Keep one on hand each
year and when you are planning your trips, let Esso Touring Service suppl 
you with maps and complete routings, and for real “Happy Motoring”—us
Esso Products and E350 Service Wherever you ﬁnd the Esso sign. "
