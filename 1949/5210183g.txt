Out in the Mid-Atlantic, south east
of the Virginia Capes, beyond the Gulf
Stream’s ﬂying ﬁsh and phosphorous,
lie the most famous coral islands in
the World. It is the Bermudas . . . less
than 20 square miles in size and so
formed that in few spots it is possible
to get more than a mile away from
the sea. The north and south shores
are utterly different and might belong
to countries hundreds of leagues
apart.

The Bermudas, with startling clar-
ity of sunlight, their gentle tropical
sea, their special ﬂash of white wash-
ed roofs, pink-tinted walls and ﬂaming
poinciana trees, and their island nights
glittering with more stars than any
other sky in the Atlantic. They are
collectively called “Bermuda.” Here
we ﬁnd a place of coveted ease, un-
hurried charm and relaxed living.

Here it may mean building castles
in the cleanest pink and white sand on
earth, wandering over coral beaches
into ocean that is the greenest green,
the bluest blue. It may mean cycling
along South Shore Road between tall,
hedges of Oleander, with youngster
and picnic lunches safely tucked in a
basket on handle bars.

Or it may be the velvety greens and
fairways of one of Bermuda’s many
golf courses. Or where attractive
shops show choicest merchandise of the
British Empire.

There are many beautifully kept
tennis courts, hidden picnic beaches,
delightful roads and coral rocks from
which a native ﬁsherman’s net may be
cast,‘ ensnaring everything including
prancing sea—horses and mermaids
singing! For, like a jewel set in Mid-
Atlantic, Bermuda is the wish at sun-
set and romance is starlight.

You go from one Parish to another
by boat, by bicycle, by the small mo:
tor car. Everywhere the place is leis-i

urely. The motor car, convenient for
visits from one end of islands to the
other, travels (by law) only a few
miles faster than average horse and
carriage. "

HOW DO I GET TO BERMUDA?

You ﬂy by the latest aircraft or you .

go by luxury liner. The plane takes
a few hours, boats from New York,
35 hours. Departures from Baltimore,
Boston, Halifax, Montreal and Eng-
‘ land. When you make reservations in-

quire about special ‘rates for children.‘
