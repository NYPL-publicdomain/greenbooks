pressure is softer, increasing driving
comfort. .

The wheelbase is 118 inches.

Mr. Denney has anndunced that
plans are progressing for establish-
ment of an exclusive Mercury dealer
organization, as well as separation of
production facilities. Prior to the war,

‘ Mercury cars were merchandised

largely through the Ford dealer or-
ganization. ,

Assembly locations for the post-war
Mercury will include the three plants
of the Lincoln Division—the Detroit
Lincoln plant at Warren and Liver- .
nois, and the two new Lincoln-Mercury 7
plants now under construction on the
East and} West coasts.

THE 1946 LINCOLN

"Detroit, Mich-The 1946 Lincoln was
. the ﬁrst of the post-war luxury auto-
mobiles to be shown to the public in

ﬁdealer showrooms throughout the naJ

_ tion.
\ According to Frank J. Denney, gen-

 eral sales manager, the new model re-

. tains the graceful lines ﬁrst introduced
a to the quality ﬁeld by Lincoln, but a
, number of improvements give the cars
a larger and more lpxurious appear-
' ance.

'Exterior improvements include wider
bumpers, to provide more protection
for fenders, and completely new bum-
per guards, heavier at the top to pre-
vent override and possible damage to
fenders and grille.

_The new grille, a massive die—casting
with a quadrated pattern, gives the
‘ front a lower, broader appearance, and

provision for built-in fog lights is a .

new safety feature that adds an at-
tractive note as well.

Electrically operated hydraulic me-
chanism. for raising and lowering
windows is a standard feature on all
.1946 Lincoln cars. This is more con-

25

venient and safer than the conven-
tional mechanism, since the driver can,
with the pressure of one ﬁnger, raise
or lower either of the car’s front
windows at any time. “

Mr.‘ Denney said that, with new
grilles, new bumpers, new color com-
binations, new rich upholstery,new
hardware throughout, new panel in-
struments, new steering wheel and
automatic window lifts, the new Lin-
coln is by all odds the most beautiful
and ﬁnest automobile yet offered the
American public.

Two models of the 1946 Lincoln are
now in production, the four-door se-
dan and the club coupe, with other
models ‘to be added soon. The new
Lincolns will be available in eight
different exterior colors.

nounced by OPA are: "
