TRANSMISSIONS -

Mr. James says that “easier to shift”
“transmissions are on their way. Clutch
pedals are likely to disappear on all
:models in the near futu1e. He is not

sure that the gear shift lever will dis-
.appearl entirely, although smaller,

~easier-to-manage levers are deﬁnitely

fifin the picture. The matter of selec-
iftivity‘ is something motorists must de-
lCide. Do they want a transmission
that is fully automatic or do they want
7; toexercise some choice in‘the matter?
,Sernij-a'utomatic and fully automatic

transmissions are alreadfy a reality.

The cars of the ‘future Will deter-
“ mine the kind of fuel we get accord-
j ing to Mr. James. (He points out that
a car lasts seven years; a fuel only
” seven weeks from reﬁnery to engine.'

LIGHT METAL AND PLASTICS

Chief trouble with aluminum is that
