MONEY EOR . NEGRO COLLEGES

\ This year more than ever we must see to it that our colleges are prepared, _: ‘ ._
to carry a maximum load of work, and ready to do it well. One group of; < "
colleges deserves Special attention in this respect: the institutions that
devote themselves to education of the Negro., Under the leadership of the ,
United Negro College Fund thirty-three of these private: colleges are begin- ‘
'ning a campaign for $1,300,000. John D. Rockefeller Jr. is chairman of the
advisory committee for this third annual fund drive, and anumber of other i ~

- prominent men and women have interested themselves in the cause.

The need for full subscription is more pressing this year because of the
unusual burden thrown on all educational facilities by the returning veteran.
The Negro played an important and often heroic, part in the war. He, shared
the mud, the danger, the sweat and the tears. N ow he has the right to

- continue his interrupted education if he wants to .do so. Many college doors
" will be closed to him, and to others regardless of race, color or creed, simply-4
because there are “too many returning» veterans to be cared for at Once in
the colleges ‘of their choice. But we cannot allow thlese thirty-three Negro
private colleges to turn away any applicant because they lack funds, or to
curtail their programs because of it. , ’ ,

. , _ ' The educated Negro was once a rarity. His numbers are increasing year
.by year, and his contributions to the arts, science and education steadily
. , gain a, wider and juster recognition for his abilities. From these we all gain,
’ regardless of color. And, as ‘we mutually put a proper, . unprejudiced estimate
,1 on the contributions Of all races to the common good, we move surely

j closer to the goal of living together in harmony.
