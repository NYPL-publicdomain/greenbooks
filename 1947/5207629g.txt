Editors Note :-The following article is as nearly as is possible, arrepro-
duction of a discussion between Wendall P. Alston and James A. Jackson, both

1. ,TSpecial Representatives of the Esso Marketers.

_ JAMES A. JACKSON, the senior has attempted! to reproduce his reactions
to the book and its ﬁeld of usefulness, by reminiscing a bit about his earl:
gtraVels. In the pursuit of a livlihood since the dawn of the century, Mr\ Jack

«son has Covered a lot of territory. He has actually visited 1997 towns and cities
*1'in the United States and on several trips abroad has been in Nineteen fareign

' ' Counuies. He has been in so many communities in America as to be quite at
home in most of them, because of his frequent visits, as time went on. '

His present position, held for the past twelve years, after seven years in th
, 3U. S. De.pt of Commerce and six with the Billboard, a theatrical magazme ”18
.with the Public Relations Department of the Standard Oil Co. and its afiilia
companies. Mr. W. P. Alston has for the past two years been his traveli 11g

companion, and his potential successor. Together they go about to the eXtent «if
‘ around 20,000 miles per year ’

But let them tell their own story:-

When this article reaches print in the 1947 issue of the Green Book the
authors of this little brochure will be wandering down in Louisiana, and Ark-

i 1 . ansas; and in fact one of us will have been‘ across the border and into Texa

i For about six weeks beginning right after Xmas, we Will be on a trip of more
than three thousand miles, involving fourteen stops in each state. 1

. Both of us are experienced travellers and one is especially fortiﬁed With
contacts in many towns and cities which he has been visiting at intervals for,
in some instances, more than forty years. The gray headed member of this
team, whose experiences indicate his age, but whose energy and will to get
about this and other countries, seems to be undiminished. 1
Of course, like all old codgers, he is inclined to reminisce at almost any

*opportunity. Talk of the Green Book and mention of comparisons since its ﬁrst
publication a scant half dozen years ago, has just set him off.

“Gee” said he, “If there had been any such publication as this When I
«started travelling ‘way back in the Nineties, I would have missed a lotof
1 anxieties, worries and saved a lot of mental energy which, had it been cot-14:,
served and used solely to the advancement of the business interests for which If
'_traveled, my years “on the road’- might have been Concluded long ago, With"
enough savings to permit my living a life of peace and quiet, now that I am
becoming an old codger.”
