ENGINES ,
Mr. James feels that the convent

best power source available for the
present auto-mobile. He sees lighter, 
more compact, engines creating far! 

greater horsepower for a given dis- ‘

pressions will go much higher. Higher
compressions, he says, impose greater

strains on bearings, create higher tem-  '

peratures, result‘in a “high strung” or
tempermental engine in frequent need
of attention. ' i

He says there is a possibility the 
same end—~greater horsepower for a.  
given displacement and weight—may 
be achieved by the use of superchar'n , 
gers.

According "to Mr. James, gas tut:
