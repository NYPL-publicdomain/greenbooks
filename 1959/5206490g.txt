No travel guide is perfect. The changing conditions as all
know contribute to this condition.

The listings in this guide are carefully checked, despite ‘

this, past experiences have shown that from the time that we

check to the time that you use our guide, changes have been 
made. Therefore, at this point may we emphasize that these 
11stings are printed just as they are presented to us and we 

would like your cooperation and understanding, that the pub-
lishers are not responsible after this check has been made.

If you should experience unpleasant or unsatisfactory serv-
ice at any of the places listed, you will do your fellow traveler
a favor by reporting this place to us.

INFORMATION

In planning your trip or tour, secure a road map from
your local service station for the trip that you expect to take.
Plan your trip from this map, noting the route and cities that
you are to pass through, then you can make note of the
accommodations in the cities that you are to pass through in
case you might want to stop over. No maps are published in
our guide as they would not be legible for your convenience.

DON’T BE DISAPPOINTED—Make reservations in ad- 

 

vance. State date of arrival, number of persons in your party 

adults or children and the number of single or double beds

required. After conﬁrmation of your reservation get rates ,
and send one night’s lodgings to be certain reservations are r

held.
