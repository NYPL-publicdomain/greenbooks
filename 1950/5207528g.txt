INTRODUCTION

With the introduction of this travel
guide in 1936, it has been our idea
to give the Negro traveler informa-
tion that will keep him from running
into difficulties, embarrassments and
to make his trips more enjoyable.

The Jewish press has long pub-
lished information about places that
are restricted and there are numer-
ous publications that give the gentile
whites all kinds of information. But
during these long years of discrim-
ination, before 1936 other guides have
been published for the Negro, some
are still published, but the majority

, have gone out of business for various

reasons.

In 1936 the Green Book was only
a local publication for Metropolitan
New YOrk, the response for copies
was so great it was turned'into a
national issue in 1937 to cover the
United States. This guide while lack-
ing in manyrespects was accepted by
thousands of travelers. Through the
courtesy of the United States Travel
Bureau of which Mr. Chas. A. R.
McDowell was the collaborator on
Negro Affairs, more valuable infor-
mation was secured. With the two
working together, this guide contained,
the best ideas for the Negro travelers
Year after year it grew until 1941
“PM” one of New York’s great white‘
newspapers found out about it. Wrote
an article about the guide and praised
it highly. At the present time the
guide contains 80 pages and lists nu-

merous business places, including
whites which cater to the Negro trade.

There are thousands of first class
business places that we don’t know
about and can’t list, which would be
glad to serve the traveler, but it is
hard to secure listings of these places
since we can’t secure enough agents
to send us the information. Each year
before we go to press the new infor-
mation is included in the new edition.

When you are traveling please

'mention the Green Book, in order

that they might know how you found
their place of business, as they can
see that you are strangers. If they
haven't heard about this guide, ask
them to get in touch with us so that
we might list their place.

If this guide has proved useful to
you on your trips, let us know. If not,
tell us also as we appreciate your
criticisms and ideas in the improve-

ment of this guide from which you
benefit.

There will be a day sometime in
the near future when this guide will
not have to be published. That is
when we as a race will have equal
opportunities and privileges in the
United States. It will be a great
day for us to suspend this publica-
tion for then we can go wherever
we please, and without embarrass-
ment. But until that time comes we
shall continue to publish this infor-

mation for your convenience each
year.
