In keeping with the new speed lines
are the redesigned rear fenders, also
air-foil type, and the large vertical tail
lights which ﬁt into the trailing edge
of the fenders. Both. front and rear
fenders are the bolt—on type.

The wheel bases of all 1950 Stude-
baker models have been increased by
one inch: Champion, 113 inches; Com-
mander, 120 inches; Land Cruiser, 124-
inehes. Overall. lengths of the cars are:
Champion, 19734 inches; Commander
207%; inches; and Land Cruiser, 211%
inches.

Instrument panels are located about
four inches farther forward than pre-
viously, thus providing additional space
in the front compartment. Gauges are
grouped directly in front of the driver
so that they can be checked at a glance.

In these new models the company
continues its ﬂair for luxurious up-
holstery and generous use, of leatherette
trim. Because of the popularity of
nylon, ﬁrst used by Studebaker in the

Land Cruiser, and because of its proved :

durability, the company is introducing '
it in all Regal Deluxe models of the .
‘ Commander series and in two patterns
on both the Champion and Commander ‘ ‘

convertibles. Leather upholstery is op-'
tional on the convertibles at no extra
charge. Foam rubber cushions are

standard equipment in all models with ,
priced

the exception of the lower

Deluxe Champion.

An unusual feature of the Studebaker
coil spring front suspension lies in the 3
fact that both upper and lower control
arms are pivoted so that they rake to '
the rear about 15 degrees. This has the
effect of cushioning the ride on rough
roads since the front Wheels tend to
“travel away” from a bump as the car ;
is driven over it. Rubber insulation is
used at the top and bOttom of each coil ?
spring. Shock absorbers on the Cham-T'
pion are the direct-acting tubular type . '
while the Commander utilizes the
double-acting link-and-lever variety. '
