Studebaker, the car that set the post-
war styling pace for the automobile

industry, has done it again.

Details of the company’s line of 1950
model passenger cars were disclosed to-
day by H. S. Vance, chairman of the
board and president, with a prediction
that this latest Studebaker will be
acclaimed the most distinctive looking
car on the road.

In these new cars the company’s de—
signers, Raymond Loewy Associates,
have achieved an automotive style pat—
tern as revolutionary today as were the
ﬁrst Studebakers of postwar design
three years ago. A complete change in
frontal appearance and fender treat-
ment gives the 1950 models sleek, new
lines which make them appear in mo—
tion even when they’re standing still.

Both ride and handling ease have
been considerably bettered by engineer-
ing innovations complementing the use
of an improved self-stabilizing “coil
spring front suspension.

The front of the 1950 Studebaker is
particularly striking. It embodies an
airplane fuselage—type hood, ﬂanked by
air—“foil front fenders and set off by a
chrome “spinner.” In addition to pro-
viding an ornamentaltouch, the “spin-
ner” augments four frontal openings
which direct air to the engine for
maximum cooling. The largest of these
air passages consists of two oval-shaped
honeycomb grille scoops located below.
the two smaller air channels which
ﬂank the “spinner.” Chrome moldings
over these small twin channels con-
tribute to the unusual decorative effect.

FRONT EIND DESIGN OF THE NEW
1950 STUDEBAKER MODELS IS PAR-

TICULARLY STRIKING. THE “SPIN-
NER," IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A
HANDSOME ORNAMENTAL TOUCH,
AUGUMENTS FOUR FRONTAL OPEN-
INGS WHICH DIRECT AIR TO THE EN-
GINE. THE LARGEST OF THESE AIR
PASSAGES CONSISTS OF TWO OVAL-
SHAPED HONEYCOMIB GRILLE SCOO- I
PS LOCATED BELOW TWO SMALLER
AIR CHANNELS WHICH FLANK THE

“SPINNER.”

In harmony with a styling that
expresses power, speed and sleekness
are the heavy wrap—around bumpers. In‘
front they are held by supports en-
closed within tubular housings which,
are painted to match the automobile.
