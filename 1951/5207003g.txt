service on the 718 mile scenic run between San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, it cuts three hours off the previous
speediest schedule between the two cities, at fares lower than former coach fares. The chair-car train features ”sky-
view windows” one third larger than the already oversize windows of the other "Davlights," zone heating and feather
touch doors. In addition to nine chair cars, the strea‘mliner also carries a tavern refreshment car, triple unit of full

length diner—coffee shop-kitchen cars, and parlor observation.
