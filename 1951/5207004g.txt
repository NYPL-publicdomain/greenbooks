have been installed, and these are im—
proved in almost every way over those
in use even a decade ago.

These cars, along with the other
modern cars in service and those be—
ing continually installed, go a long
way in making rail travel more com—
fortable and convenient than ever be—
fore. Whether the trip be in a coach
or a sleeping car, every effort has
been made to assure a more pleasant
journey.

Fluorescent lighting bathes the in-
terior of these new cars With glare-
less, even light, and many cars fea-
ture individually controlled lights.
Careful attention has been given to
interior decoration of cars, and they
have restful color combinations such
as blue, grey and ivory walls and

ceilings and with rose upholstery and
carpets.

Seating facilities in the new coaches
offer all the comfort that improved
design can give them. Reclining seats
With adjustable footrests invite relaxa-
tion, and many seats can be swung
around to provide a clear, unobstructed
View of the countryside through wide
Windows.

Coach lounges are larger and more
luxurious, and have comfortable chairs,
large mirrors and additional wash
basins. Electro-pneumatic devices cause
doors to open at the touch of a ﬁnger
and remain open until the traveler
has passed. -

Spaciousness is the keynote of new
coaches. This greater space for each
passenger is reﬂected in such things
as more leg room between seats and
