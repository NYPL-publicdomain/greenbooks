for longer distances and at greater
sustained speeds. They help to explain
why the United States today has the
largest number of high—speed passen—
ger trains in the world.

Although they might escape the
passenger’s attention, there are also
many improvements in roadway and
structures. Rails .are heavier and
stronger, and in combination with
better ballasted roadbed give the foun—
dation for smoother-riding passenger
cars. Reduction of grades and elimina—
tion of curves contribute greatly to
faster, more comfortable rides. Faster
and safer rides also come from im—
proved signals of all kinds, and cen-
tralized traffic control, which enables
an operator to control train move—
ments over a wide area from a master
control board.

 

Just as constant investment in new

railroad equipment means greater com- '

fort and dependability for the traveler,
it has also meant greater safety. In
1949, the railroad safety record was
better than ever before. There was
but one passenger fatality for each
one billion four hundred million miles
traveled. To travel that far, a passen-
ger would have to ride on a fast train,
making a mile a minute, every hour
of the day and night, for the next two

’ thousand years.

But even with the much better
equipment and roadway which the
railroads have in service today, a con—
stant program of research and im-
provement is being carried on to the

end that the railroads can continue to '

produce more comfortable, dependable
and safer transportation at ‘the lowest
possible cost.
