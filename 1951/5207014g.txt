New York is to America, a melting
pot.

These people brought to Los
Angeles their traditions, customs and
ideals, which accounts for the various
forms of worships and the variety of
architectural structures.

The chief industry of Los Angeles
is the production of motion pictures,
thereby giving it the distinction of
being the motion picture Capital of
the world.

Its citrus fruits industry places it
at the top of the agricultural list, be-
ing sixth and brings some $131,000,000
a year. Sportswear is the city’s third
ranking industry. The production of
oil—well equipment and drill tools, puts
it in a ﬁrst ranking position in that
ﬁeld. The city stretches out touching
such suburbs as Hollywood, Beverly
Hills, Universal City, Glendale and
Burbank.

Interesting Places To See:
The famed Forest Lawn Cemetery,

, located in Glendale-where the crypts

of many Hollywood notables are open
to visitors daily—and replicas of fa-
mous little churches from all Saints
of the world, where one can attend
services, etc.

There are the studios where by ap-
pointment passes are issued to visitors.
Small communities such as, Little
Mexico and Little Tokyo With their
traditional theatres and stores—the
splendid shopping centers in the heart
of the city and on the Strip—which
is Sunset Blvd, and of course the
wonderful Huntington Library.

. are available.

Vacation Resorts:

The most outstanding of which is
Lake Elsimore—which is located in
the foothill of the rolling San Ber-
du Mountains, about 75 miles from
Los Angeles. Conveniently located
near Elsimore are Motels and Traveler
parking lots. Mrs. T. J. Mundy’s
Auto Court offers every convenience
at reasonable rates. In connection with
Elsimore Inn—there are cabins which
Hendricks Auto Court
also offers every convenience and both
places remain open the year round.
There are also cabins available on the
beautiful ranch owned by Dr. N.
Curtis King and Mr. Clarence Muse.

The famed San Juan Capistrano is
also near Elsimore and affords excel—
lent Dove Shooting. Val Verte, an-
other resort, located conveninently to
Los Angeles offers horseback riding,
hiking, a swimming pool and a dance
pavillion. Other popular vacation spots
are—Lake Henshaw, which offers
good ﬁshing, and Mrs. Murray’s Dude
Ranch in the desert. Cabins can be
obtained on Catalina Island, whose
main attractions are its beaches.

Tijuana, Mexico, which is just a
few hours across the border, holds
many attractions for the tourist, how—
ever it is not convenient to remain
one night; San Diego being the near-
est point to hotels.

Our most modern and largest Motel
in Los Angeles is owned by Ray Ro—
berson. The auto is almost a “must”
in this section of the country, as most
of the places mentioned are distances
apart, and transportation is the one
poor feature of Los Angeles.
